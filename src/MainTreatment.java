// this class should use either naive bayes methods or K means or both 


// To do classification first use training data that is naturally separate and then try to get k means clustering parameters 
//after obtaining the parameters of K means we can then assign a new document to a cluster this can be done by 
// calculating the parameters of the new data and comparing it to the nearest centroid , after that assign each
//cluster a class by counting the number of documents from the training set belonging to a particular class 
//the highest percentage class is the class of the cluster and the class of the new document .
